# *PinTourist*

> "Let's Pin the world"

##  

PinTourist is a project of 3 Computer Engineering students of La Sapienza University that are trying to make a smarter Rome #PinableRome

Imagine a smart phone application that can
- Tell you where the monuments and hot spots in your city are 
- Give you short blurbs of information about the monuments when you are near them
- Give you information on bars and restaurants near the monument you're closest to
- Challenge your friends by visiting the most monuments with mini bonus quizes pertaining to the monument you're near
